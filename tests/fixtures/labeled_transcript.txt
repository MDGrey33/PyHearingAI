**Speaker 2:** So, Yaacob, the conversation started. What did I tell you that we're going to do?

**Speaker 2:** You told me that you're going to ask me some questions, so yeah.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, so now I guess I asked you a question and you answered me, right?

**Speaker 1:** Yeah.

**Speaker 1:** So this should work.

**Speaker 1:** It must.

**Speaker 1:** Perfect.

**Speaker 2:** Now, tell me something and I will try to talk over you while you're talking to see if it's going to be able to know which one is me, which one is you, even if we're talking over each other.

**Speaker 2:** Did you know that some people have beautiful fingers?

**Speaker 0:** No way.

**Speaker 2:** Oh my God.

**Speaker 0:** Thank you, Yaacob.
