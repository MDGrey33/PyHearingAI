# PyHearingAI Project TODO List

## Development Workflow Improvements

### Pre-commit Optimization
- [ ] Optimize the pre-commit workflow to reduce commit time
  - [ ] Configure to run only relevant tests for changed files
  - [ ] Run black in a separate step before committing
  - [ ] Add option to skip full test suite for minor changes
  - [ ] Separate documentation updates from code commits
  - [ ] Cache test results when possible

### CLI Installation
- [ ] Ensure the CLI works as a direct command when installed
  - [ ] Configure proper entry_points in setup.py
  - [ ] CLI should work with just `transcribe` command without `python -m`
  - [ ] Add bash/zsh completion for the CLI
  - [ ] Verify CLI works across different installation methods (pip, poetry, homebrew)

### Test Process Streamlining
- [ ] Improve test efficiency and organization
  - [ ] Parallelize tests where possible
  - [ ] Only run the full suite on push, not commit
  - [ ] Add test categories (fast, slow, integration)
  - [ ] Implement test fixtures for common scenarios
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Documentation
- [ ] Enhance documentation
  - [ ] Update README.md to reflect latest changes
  - [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
  - [ ] Add more examples for different use cases
  - [ ] Create user guide with common workflows
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues
