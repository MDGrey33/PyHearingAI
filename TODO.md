# PyHearingAI Implementation Plan

## Idempotent Processing Implementation Plan

This implementation plan outlines the steps to add idempotent processing capabilities to PyHearingAI, which will enable processing of long multilingual recordings with resilience to interruptions.

  - [ ] Create enums for status tracking

- [ ] **Repository Layer**
  - [ ] Implement `JobRepository` with JSON persistence
  - [ ] Implement `ChunkRepository` for storing chunk metadata
  - [ ] Implement `SegmentRepository` for speaker segments

- [ ] **Feature Flag System**
  - [ ] Add `USE_IDEMPOTENT_PROCESSING` flag to `config.py`
  - [ ] Set up conditional paths for feature activation

- [ ] **Audio Processing**
  - [ ] Create `AudioChunkingService` with configurable chunk size

  - [ ] Add timestamp conversion utilities
  - [ ] Create test fixtures for audio processing

### Sprint 2: Diarization and Transcription (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] **Diarization Service**
  - [ ] Create `DiarizationService` wrapper for existing adapters
  - [ ] Modify Pyannote adapter for chunk awareness
  - [ ] Implement storage for diarization results
  - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing interface

- [ ] **Begin Transcription Service**
  - [ ] Start creating `TranscriptionService` interface
  - [ ] Begin adapting Whisper adapter for chunk awareness
  - [ ] Design storage for transcription results
  - [ ] Set up isolated testing environment

### Sprint 3: Transcription and Reconciliation (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] **Complete Transcription Service**
  - [ ] Finalize segment-level transcription
  - [ ] Implement whole-chunk transcription
  - [ ] Complete transcription repository
  - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility

- [ ] **Reconciliation Service**
  - [ ] Implement basic `ReconciliationService`
  - [ ] Create GPT-4 integration for advanced reconciliation
  - [ ] Design prompt templates for different scenarios
  - [ ] Develop storage for reconciled results

- [ ] **Cross-Module Integration Testing**
  - [ ] Test diarization and transcription interaction
  - [ ] Verify result consistency across chunks
  - [ ] Test multilingual content handling

### Sprint 4: CLI and Orchestration (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] **CLI Enhancements**
  - [ ] Add `--resume` flag to CLI
  - [ ] Add `--show-chunks` flag for progress reporting
  - [ ] Implement job lookup for resumption
  - [ ] Create dual flow based on feature flag

- [ ] **Orchestration Layer**
  - [ ] Create main workflow orchestrator
  - [ ] Implement job management functions
  - [ ] Add progress tracking and reporting
  - [ ] Connect all services into coherent workflow

- [ ] **Initial End-to-End Testing**
  - [ ] Test with short audio files
  - [ ] Verify resumability after interruption
  - [ ] Test with multilingual content

### Sprint 5: Finalization (1 week)

- [ ] **Configuration**
  - [ ] Complete configuration options for idempotent processing
  - [ ] Create settings for chunk size, storage location, etc.
  - [ ] Implement configuration migration utilities
  - [ ] Remove feature flags for stable components

- [ ] **Regression Testing**
  - [ ] Verify all original functionality works
  - [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions
  - [ ] Validate performance with long recordings

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Update user documentation
  - [ ] Create developer documentation
  - [ ] Add examples for common use cases

## Assessment Criteria

After each sprint, evaluate implementation using these criteria:

### Functionality Assessment
- Does the implemented feature meet all requirements?
- Are there any regressions in existing functionality?
- Is the feature compatible with other components?

### Quality Assessment
- Does the output quality match or exceed the original implementation?
- Are there any new edge cases or failure modes?
- Is error handling comprehensive and robust?

### Performance Assessment
- How does processing speed compare to the original implementation?
- Is memory usage acceptable, especially for long recordings?
- Are there any unexpected performance bottlenecks?

### User Experience Assessment
- Is the feature intuitive to use?
- Does it integrate well with existing CLI structure?
- Are error messages clear and helpful?

## Success Metrics

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Functionality**: The system can successfully process long, multilingual recordings
2. **Resilience**: Processing can be resumed after interruption with no data loss
3. **Resource Usage**: Memory usage remains stable regardless of recording length
4. **Quality**: Transcription results match or exceed the quality of the original implementation
5. **User Experience**: The system is intuitive to use with clear progress reporting
