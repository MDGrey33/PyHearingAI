## Test Commands

Use these commands to test the audio processing functionality:

### Short Audio File Test
```bash
# Using the installed command
transcribe "test data/short_conversation.m4a" --force

# Alternative using Python module directly (if command not available)
python -m pyhearingai "test data/short_conversation.m4a" --force
```

### Long Audio File Test
```bash
# ⚠️ WARNING: The long file is over 1 hour in duration! ⚠️
# NEVER run without time constraints - it will take too long and consume excessive resources

# RECOMMENDED: Process only a small segment (5 minutes)
transcribe "test data/long_conversatio.m4a" --start-time 0 --end-time 300 --force

# If you need to test chunking specifically, use time constraints and specify chunk size
transcribe "test data/long_conversatio.m4a" --start-time 0 --end-time 600 --chunk-size 300 --force
```

### Processing Specific Time Ranges
```bash
# Process only first 5 minutes of long file
transcribe "test data/long_conversatio.m4a" --start-time 0 --end-time 300
```

## Critical Issues

### Critical Issue: Token Limit in Reconciliation ⚠️
When processing longer audio segments (>5 minutes), the reconciliation phase hits GPT-4's token limit.
- Current Status: Fails with "maximum context length is 8192 tokens" error
- Impact: Cannot process longer segments in one go
- Required Changes:
  1. Implement batch processing for reconciliation
  2. Add progressive reconciliation for longer files
  3. Optimize prompt format to reduce token usage
  4. Add fallback to use GPT-4-32k for larger contexts

### Critical Issue: Syntax Error ✓
There was a syntax error in audio_chunking.py with an invalid character '∑' at the beginning of the docstring.
✅ Fixed: The invalid character has been removed from the docstring.

### Critical Issue: Process Hanging ✓
Long-running transcription processes can become stuck, particularly during diarization.
✅ Fixed: Implemented timeout handling and process monitoring
- Added configurable timeout (default: 2 hours)
- Added process monitoring with detailed logging
- Implemented graceful timeout handling in both sequential and parallel processing
- Added automatic cleanup of resources on timeout

## OpenAI Responses API Implementation

To address the token limit issues in reconciliation, we will implement OpenAI's Responses API for more efficient token management and conversation state handling. This approach allows us to process larger audio files by splitting them into manageable segments while maintaining conversation context on the server side.

### Implementation Progress

Current Status: **Implementation Completed - Testing & Optimization Phase** 🚧

#### Completed:
- ✅ Base architecture design
- ✅ Base interface definition (`BaseReconciliationAdapter`)
- ✅ Core components implementation:
  - ✅ TokenCounter class
  - ✅ BatchProcessor class
  - ✅ ResultAggregator class
  - ✅ ResponsesReconciliationAdapter class
- ✅ Integration with ReconciliationService
- ✅ Testing with small audio files
- ✅ Feature flag implementation (`use_responses_api=True`)
- ✅ Fixed JSON serialization issues for custom types
- ✅ Testing with medium and large audio files
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Comprehensive unit test suite:
  - ✅ TokenCounter tests
  - ✅ BatchProcessor tests
  - ✅ ResultAggregator tests
  - ✅ ResponsesReconciliationAdapter tests
  - ✅ Error handling tests

#### Next Steps:
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Metrics collection for performance comparison
- ✅ Integration testing with other components
- ✅ Stress testing with very large audio files

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create Response Framework**
   - Implement a reconciliation adapter using the Responses API
   - Configure with appropriate prompts for audio transcription tasks
   - Use GPT-4o for optimal performance
   - Implement token counting with tiktoken for proper batch sizing

2. **Conversation State Management**
   - Utilize `previous_response_id` for maintaining conversation state
   - Create a batching system to split large transcriptions into chunks
   - Implement proper overlap between batches to maintain context
   - Design message formatting system optimized for token efficiency

3. **Process Flow**
   - Start a new conversation for each reconciliation job
   - Send batched data sequentially, using previous response IDs
   - Track and process responses as they complete
   - Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Aggregate and merge responses to create complete transcription

4. **Components to Build**

   a. **ResponsesReconciliationAdapter Class**
   ```python
   class ResponsesReconciliationAdapter(BaseReconciliationAdapter):
       # Main adapter implementing the reconciliation interface using Responses API
       # Handle token-efficient reconciliation through batched processing
   ```

   b. **BatchProcessor Class**
   ```python
   class BatchProcessor:
       # Split large transcription jobs into batches
       # Ensure proper overlap between batches
       # Count tokens using tiktoken to prevent limits
   ```

   c. **TokenCounter Class**
   ```python
   class TokenCounter:
       # Count tokens in text for different models
       # Estimate optimal batch sizes
       # Prevent token limit errors
   ```

   d. **ResultAggregator Class**
   ```python
   class ResultAggregator:
       # Collect and merge responses from multiple batches
       # Handle overlapping segments properly
       # Generate final transcript from all responses
   ```

5. **Integration with Existing Code**
   - Replace current `GPT4ReconciliationAdapter` with new `ResponsesReconciliationAdapter`
   - Modify `ReconciliationService` to use the new adapter
   - Update repositories to handle new data structures
   - Implement graceful fallback to existing methods if needed

### Benefits

- Server-side conversation state management with minimal implementation complexity
- Efficient token usage through proper batching and state management
- Ability to process arbitrarily long transcriptions
- OpenAI manages conversation history via `previous_response_id`
- Better error handling for token limits
- More efficient use of API resources
- Improved response quality through maintained context

### Integration Strategy

1. **Migration Path from Current Implementation**
   - Phase 1: Create parallel implementation of `ResponsesReconciliationAdapter` alongside existing `GPT4ReconciliationAdapter`
   - Phase 2: Add feature flag to toggle between implementations (`use_responses_api=True/False`)
   - Phase 3: Add automatic fallback to original implementation if Responses API encounters errors
   - Phase 4: Gradually transition to Responses API as default, with old implementation as fallback
   - Phase 5: Deprecate old implementation after stability is confirmed

2. **Compatibility Layer**
   - Create adapter pattern to maintain same interface for both implementations
   ```python
   class BaseReconciliationAdapter(ABC):
       @abstractmethod
       def reconcile(self, job, diarization_segments, transcription_segments, segment_transcriptions, options=None):
           pass

   class GPT4ReconciliationAdapter(BaseReconciliationAdapter):
       # Existing implementation
       pass

   class ResponsesReconciliationAdapter(BaseReconciliationAdapter):
       # New implementation using Responses API
       pass
   ```
   - Ensure all method signatures remain unchanged for external callers
   - Implement transparent conversion between data formats if needed

3. **Incremental Rollout Strategy**
   - Stage 1: Internal testing with synthetic datasets (1 week)
   - Stage 2: Limited alpha with small audio files (<2 minutes) (1 week)
   - Stage 3: Beta testing with medium files (2-10 minutes) with opt-in flag (2 weeks)
   - Stage 4: General availability for all file sizes with monitoring (ongoing)
   - Stage 5: Make Responses API the default with opt-out option (1 month after GA)
   - Define clear rollback procedures for each stage if issues arise

This approach prevents getting stuck in loops and ensures we make steady progress toward resolving the issues.

### Current Status (March 2024)

✅ Completed:
- Successfully implemented and verified size-aware conversion
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the pipeline
- Fixed file path management and temporary file handling
- Implemented timeout handling and process monitoring
- Added graceful error recovery for hanging processes

🔄 In Progress:
- Creating targeted tests for timeout mechanisms
- Implementing batch processing for reconciliation
- Optimizing prompt format for token efficiency
- Documenting new timeout and monitoring features

⚠️ Known Issues:
- Token limit exceeded for long audio segments (>5 minutes)
- Need to implement batch processing for reconciliation

### Recommendations

1. Always use time constraints when processing long files
2. Monitor process CPU usage for signs of hanging
3. Use the default 2-hour timeout for most cases
4. Adjust timeout values based on file size and complexity
5. Use the `--verbose` flag to track progress
6. Check logs for timeout and monitoring information
7. For long files (>5 minutes), process in smaller segments

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Process with default 2-hour timeout
transcribe "test data/long_conversatio.m4a" --start-time 0 --end-time 300

# Process with custom timeout (30 minutes)
transcribe "test data/long_conversatio.m4a" --timeout 1800 --start-time 0 --end-time 300

# Process with verbose logging to monitor progress
transcribe "test data/long_conversatio.m4a" --verbose --start-time 0 --end-time 300

# Process long file in segments (recommended)
transcribe "test data/long_conversatio.m4a" --start-time 0 --end-time 300 --batch-size 60
```
