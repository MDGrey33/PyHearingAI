# ResponsesReconciliationAdapter Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan outlines the strategy for thoroughly testing the `ResponsesReconciliationAdapter` to ensure it correctly addresses token limit issues and efficiently processes audio files of various lengths. The plan covers testing across different audio durations, content types, and system conditions.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify that the `ResponsesReconciliationAdapter` correctly processes audio files of varying lengths
2. Confirm that token limits are properly managed through batching
3. Validate the accuracy of speaker diarization and transcription reconciliation
4. Assess performance characteristics and resource usage
5. Test error handling and edge cases
6. Compare results with the standard reconciliation adapter

## Test Matrix

| Test Case | Audio Duration | Content Type | Expected Outcome | Priority |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|------------------|----------|
| TC-01 | Short (< 1 min) | Single speaker | Complete successfully | High |
| TC-02 | Short (< 1 min) | Multiple speakers | Complete successfully | High |
| TC-03 | Medium (1-5 min) | Multiple speakers | Complete successfully | High |
| TC-04 | Long (5-15 min) | Multiple speakers | Complete successfully | Medium |
| TC-05 | Very long (> 15 min) | Multiple speakers | Complete with multiple batches | Medium |
| TC-06 | Various | Non-English content | Correct handling of non-English text | Low |
| TC-07 | Various | Background noise | Robust against background noise | Low |
| TC-08 | Various | Overlapping speech | Correctly identify speaker changes | Medium |

## Test Environments

1. **Development Environment**
   - Local machine with controlled resources
   - Small to medium audio files
   - Quick iteration and debugging

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated tests with predefined audio samples
   - Regression testing to catch issues
   - Performance benchmarking

3. **Production-like Environment**
   - Tests with real-world audio samples
   - Resource constraints similar to production
   - End-to-end workflow testing

## Test Procedures

### TC-01: Short Single Speaker Audio

1. **Setup**
   - Prepare a short (30-60 second) audio file with a single speaker
   - Configure the system to use `ResponsesReconciliationAdapter`

2. **Execution**
   - Process the audio file with `transcribe(audio_path, use_responses_api=True)`
   - Record processing time, token usage, and result accuracy

3. **Verification**
   - Verify that transcription is accurate
   - Confirm speaker is correctly identified
   - Check processing completed without errors
   - Compare results with standard adapter

### TC-03: Medium Multiple Speakers Audio

1. **Setup**
   - Prepare a medium (3-5 minute) audio file with multiple speakers
   - Configure the system to use `ResponsesReconciliationAdapter`

2. **Execution**
   - Process the audio file with `transcribe(audio_path, use_responses_api=True)`
   - Monitor batch creation and processing
   - Record processing time, token usage, and result accuracy

3. **Verification**
   - Verify that transcription is accurate for all speakers
   - Confirm speaker changes are correctly identified
   - Check that batching worked correctly
   - Compare results with standard adapter
   - Verify no token limit errors occurred

### TC-05: Very Long Multiple Speakers Audio

1. **Setup**
   - Prepare a very long (>15 minute) audio file with multiple speakers
   - Configure the system to use `ResponsesReconciliationAdapter`
   - Set appropriate timeouts for the long-running test

2. **Execution**
   - Process the audio file with `transcribe(audio_path, use_responses_api=True)`
   - Monitor batch creation and processing
   - Record processing time, token usage, and result accuracy per batch
   - Monitor system resource usage during processing

3. **Verification**
   - Verify that multiple batches were created and processed
   - Confirm all batches were successfully reconciled
   - Check that speaker changes across batch boundaries are handled correctly
   - Verify no token limit errors occurred
   - Assess overall transcript quality and accuracy

## Performance Testing

1. **Token Usage Analysis**
   - Compare token usage between standard and Responses API adapters
   - Measure token efficiency for different audio lengths
   - Identify opportunities for further token optimization

2. **Processing Time Measurements**
   - Record and compare processing times for different audio lengths
   - Break down time spent in each processing phase
   - Identify bottlenecks in the pipeline

3. **Resource Utilization**
   - Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage during processing
   - Identify resource constraints and optimization opportunities
   - Test with different concurrency settings

## Error Handling Tests

1. **Network Interruptions**
   - Simulate network failures during API calls
   - Verify retry mechanisms work correctly
   - Ensure partial results are preserved

2. **Token Limit Edge Cases**
   - Test with audio content that produces unusually large token counts
   - Verify batching algorithm correctly handles these cases
   - Confirm no data is lost in edge case scenarios

3. **Invalid Input Handling**
   - Test with malformed or corrupted audio files
   - Verify appropriate error messages are generated
   - Confirm the system fails gracefully and provides useful diagnostics

## Integration Tests

1. **End-to-End Pipeline**
   - Test the complete audio processing pipeline with Responses API enabled
   - Verify all components work together correctly
   - Confirm outputs are correctly saved in all supported formats

2. **CLI Integration**
   - Test command-line interface with the `--use-responses-api` flag
   - Verify feature flags work correctly
   - Confirm progress reporting is accurate

3. **Module API**
   - Test programmatic API access with Responses API enabled
   - Verify all API contract requirements are met
   - Confirm no regressions in API behavior

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All test cases in the test matrix pass successfully
2. The adapter correctly processes all audio files without token limit errors
3. Transcription and diarization accuracy is comparable to or better than the standard adapter
4. Token usage is significantly reduced for medium and long audio files
5. Processing time scales linearly with audio length
6. Error cases are handled gracefully with appropriate messages
